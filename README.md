# GPR_Emulator_cosmosis
cosmoSIS module to run the cosmo-SLICS GPR_Emulator 
Usefull for carrying out data analyses in which the signal is modelled by emulator
It assumes you independly provide the cosmo-SLICS likelihood module. 

The repository only concerns the implementation and cross-talk of the cosmo-SLICS GPR_Emulator.
I provide an example .ini file to run cosmosis on, as well as the python module (calculation and cosmoSIS interface)
